For detailed description of the model, results and technical details please refer to
the document Long_term_power_price_simulation.html

For the naming convention used in the code please refer to R Naming Convention.pdf

The repository is designed to be a self sustained R project. For this reason R portable is 
included in the repo. The R Studio included has to be pointed to the R portable path in order
to be able to use it for editing and testing the scripts.
